# World_Weather_Analysis

Created a script that allows the user to input weather parameters and parses these inputs via a Google API to return a detailed map of cities across the world that fit these parameters. From here the user can click on each city and a pop up will appear, giving a description of the current weather and local hotel suggestions.
